# Predicting the Growth and Trend of COVID-19 Pandemic

 This study applies an improved mathematical model to analyse and predict the growth of the epidemic. An ML-based improved model has been applied to predict the potential threat of COVID-19 in countries worldwide. We show that using iterative weighting for fitting Generalized Inverse Weibull distribution, a better fit can be obtained to develop a prediction framework. This has been deployed on a cloud computing platform for more accurate and real-time prediction of the growth behavior of the epidemic.

## Dataset

We use the <i>[Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/)</i> dataset for predicting number of new cases and deaths in various countries.
